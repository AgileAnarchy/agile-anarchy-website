            <h2>Agile Anarchy Manifesto (HARD TO READ? GOOOOD! >:) )</h2>
            <p>We, the players of Agile Anarchy, embrace chaos, unpredictability, and disruption. In this game, roles are fluid, 
            allegiances are temporary, and the only rule is to outwit and outlast the rest. The Scrum Master is not a guide—they are an 
            agent of disorder, challenging the status quo and pushing the game into madness.</p>
            <h2>Our Core Beliefs:</h2>
            <p>Disruption Over Stability: Stability is a lie. The Scrum Master doesn’t protect the team—they put them on the spot, making every night a mystery and every day a chance for chaos. The system must always be shaken, the calm must always be broken. We welcome disruption.</p>
            <p>Mistrust Over Harmony: Harmony breeds complacency. In Agile Anarchy, no one trusts anyone—not even their own teammates. The Scrum Master is not a servant of order but a master of uncertainty. Deception is the only path to victory.</p>
            <p>Chaos Over Control: Plans? Plans are just chains holding us back. The true power lies in embracing the chaos, where roles shift, alliances fracture, and the rules are rewritten every round. The Scrum Master will always keep you guessing, questioning, and second-guessing. Control is a myth; anarchy reigns.</p>
            <p>Cunning Over Collaboration: This isn’t a game of consensus. It’s a game of who can outsmart whom. The Scrum Master isn’t here to facilitate teamwork—they are here to tear it apart. The other roles are pawns in a grander scheme, each one vying for their own survival, but the Scrum Master alone is the true architect of anarchy.</p>
            <p>Individuality Over Unity: In this game, unity means death. Only the individuals who think for themselves and act on their own instincts will thrive. Trust no one, not even your fellow Agile members. The Scrum Master isn’t a leader of a team—they are the instigator of anarchy, pitting everyone against each other.</p>
            <p>Instability Over Comfort: Comfort breeds weakness. In Agile Anarchy, every day is a test. Will you survive the Scrum Master’s chaos? Will you betray your team? Will you take the risk to find the Bug before it evolves? Survival is a game of decisions, risks, and always being on the edge of collapse.</p>
            <p>Victory Through Deception: The true victory isn’t about following the rules—it’s about outsmarting everyone else. The Scrum Master, ever the trickster, will make it impossible to trust anyone. The only way to win is to play the game with a heart full of cunning and a mind ready to adapt. The Agile team must keep their wits about them, or they will fall under the chaos of the Anarchy.</p>
            <h2>Victory: Anarchy’s Triumph</h2>
            <p>In the end, victory belongs to those who embrace the chaos, who tear down the walls of order, and who challenge the established norms. If the Agile team can survive the unpredictability of the Scrum Master’s chaos, they may pull together a win. But if Anarchy wins, it’s because the Scrum Master led everyone to their undoing.</p>
